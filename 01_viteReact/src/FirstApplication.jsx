    -> Name the component capitalize e.g App.js
    -> We can name both App.js & App.jsx but in vite development environment we have to use jsx
    -> We can return only one component by a jsx function so it's good to wrap in <></> or <div></div>

    <></> this empty tag is known as fragment in react
